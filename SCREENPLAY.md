## Intro

_(Main Menu. Click on Start)_
_(Radio noises)_
**Radio:** Everyone listen up. There has been an incident in the Herzmut Games HQ. A histeric woman has called that something was stolen. Anyone nearby that can check?
**DJ:**** Jackson here. I'm nearby.
**Radio:** Thanks. And Dave...
**DJ:** Yes? 
**Radio:** Don't fall asleep again.

_(Car stops in front of the office)_
_(Screen switch)_
_(DJ walks into the lunch room)_

**DJ:** Hi I'm Detective Dave Jackson. Did you call us?
**Karen::** I did. Because some horrible monster ate my baby!
**DJ:** SOMEONE ATE YOUR BABY! That's horri... wait. Why did you bring your baby to the office.
**Karen::** Obviously, because I wanted to eat it.
**DJ:** YOU WANTED TO EAT YOUR BABY! 

_(NPC comes in)_

**Falko:** Karen, why are you yelling again? Some of us are trying to work here...
**Karen::** I'm not yelling. The detective is, because...
**DJ:** STOP! Let's start over. Karen was it? Please tell me what happened. In order, please.
**Karen::** Ok. So this morning I brought this super delicious, triple choclate, jumbo yoghurt and put it into my fridge.
**Falko:** The fridge isn't yours Karen. All employees are allowed to use it.
**Karen::** Stop interupting your betters. Don't you have something to clean?
**Falko:** How often shall I explain to you that "Clean Code" has nothing to do with tidying...
**Karen::** Stop wasting my time. Leave!

_(NPC leaves)_

**DJ:** Ok. Yoghurt, Fridge. What happened next?
**Karen::** So I just went for 5 minutes to the bathroom to check my Make-Up for the upcoming meeting and when I came back. It ... it ... was gone. (sniff)
**DJ:** Your yoghurt? 
**Karen::** Yes. (sniff)
**DJ:** So, you called the police, because someone stole your yoghurt?
**Karen::** Yes.
**DJ:** You know, that we're supposed to track down criminals?
**Karen::** Yes. This yoghurt thief is probably one of the worst bastards you ever had to put in jail.
**DJ:** Oh my... Well. Then I guess I'll start the "investigation" of this crime scene. See you later.
**Karen:** Do that. I'll wait right here.

## Investigation

**Fridge:** Multiple dishes and yoghurts are in here but one space is noticable empty. One yoghurt though has a "KAREN" sticker on it. **=> Journal: Karen-Label**
